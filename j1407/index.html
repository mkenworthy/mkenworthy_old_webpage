<h1>The Curious Case of J1407</h1>

<p>J1407 is a nearby young star that underwent a complex series of eclipses that
lasted for almost two months in 2007. Our best explanation is that an (as yet)
unseen massive substellar companion with a giant ring system passed in front of
the star, causing the eclipse. We haven't seen another eclipse towards J1407 (or
its full name, 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6), but data from the ALMA telescope
array has detected what might be the dust making up the rings themselves.</p>

  <p>We now give a brief history of what we've done since the eclipse was
  discovered in archival data in 2012.</p>

<h2>The discovery</h2>

<p>Mark Pecaut, a then graduate student under the supervision of Eric Mamajek at
the University of Rochester, discovered the unusual light curve towards the end
of 2011. Mark was looking at the light curves of young stars as part of his
thesis research. It is difficult to determine the ages of most stars, so several
different pieces of evidence are needed to confirm a young star. Looking through
the public light curve database of the SuperWASP collaboration, he found 1SWASP
J140747.93-394542.6, a star almost the same mass as the Sun, with a light curve
that showed a 3% variability that repeated every 3.2 days, almost certianly due
to fainter star spots on the surface of the star rotating in and out of view as
the star rotated.</p>

<p>The discovery paper (Mamajek 2012) contained a simple model including four
large rings about 0.6 au in diameter, and an estimate for how often these
systems should be detectable around other young stars.</p>

<p>Follow up observations were carried out to try and detect J1407b, which must
be several tens of Jpuiters in mass in order to keep such a large ring system
held together and not ripped apart by the gravity of the star. These included
looking for another eclipse in other photometric data (no other eclipses were
found), looking for the reflex motion of the star as the gravity of the unseen
companion tugged on it (the star is young and is very active, preventing the
method from being sensitive enough), and directly detecting the thermal glow of
the companion itself (no - even with the largest telescopes and an optical trick
called sparse aperture masking we did not see anything).</p>

<p>All these non-detections were still useful, since they allowed us to rule out
possible orbits and masses for J1407b, detailed in Kenworthy et al. 2015.</p>

<p>One interesting conclusion we had was that there were no circular orbits for
J1407b since we needed to explain why the ring system seemed to be either very
big or moving very fast in front of the star, implying that it was in an orbit
close to the star. This presented one big problem: our ring system seemed to now
be very large indeed, so large that the rings would spill away from J1407b and
fall towards the star. Putting J1407b on an elliptical orbit seemed to make the
problem even worse.</p>

<p>This inspired Steven Reider to simulate a ring system around a planet that
itself was in an elliptical orbit around the star J1407. The new trick was one
of a simple spin - if the rings were added so that they span around J1407b in
the same direction that the planet orbited around the star (called prograde
motion) then the rings fell apart within a few orbits when the planet passed
close to the star.</p>

<p>However, if the rings were spinning in the opposite direction (a retrograde
motion) then the rings held together for a much longer time, so much so that we
could find possible masses for J1407b and orbital periods that would work!</p>

<p>Even if these orbits worked, then another problem presented itself, in that
the rings were tilted with respect to the orbital plane of the planet. Most
planets rotate, and the centripetal force generated by this rotation causes the
planets to bulge out along their equators, distorting them from ideal spheres
into oblate spheroids (M&M or Smarties if you like candy/sweeties). This
deviation from an ideal sphere means that any ring system orbiting around the
planet will tend to align with the plane of the equator, as is the case with
Saturn. Since J1407b is younger and more massive than Jupiter, the bulge around
the equator is proportionally much bigger, marchalling the rings into this
plane.</p>

<p>The rings of J1407b are about 200 times larger than Saturn's rings, and for
the rings a long way away from the planet, the tidal forces of the star J1407
will force them down into the orbital plane of J1407b, some 20 degrees away. The
rings should no longer be flat, but have a large systematic warp to them, as
calculated by Zanazzi et al. in 2017.</p>

<p>Photographs of the night sky have been taken for over a century, and one of
the largest collections is at Harvard University. These photographic plates are
being scanned in digitally and published onto the internet through the DASCH
project. The process is slow and time consuming, especially as you work towards
the Galactic plane, where there are far more stars crowded together and
disentangling the signals is challenging, but they reached the location in the
Galaxy where J1407 is located around 2017. This enabled the baseline for the
J1407 lightcurve to be extended back to the 1900's, but still no eclipses were
detected. The coverage of the photographic plates from DASCH were combined with
others from Sonneborg and other more recent all sky surveys that looked towards
J1407, but still a null result, written up in Mentel et al. 2018.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the star is being observed every clear night by the dedicated
observers of the AAVSO. They watch J1407 for when the next eclipse will start.
The constraints they provide rule out successively more obital periods, leaving
J1407b with fewer orbital periods to hide in.</p>

<p>If the planet J1407b could not be detected, then how about looking for the
rings directly?</p>

<p>The rings are probably made of small rock or icy particles, ranging from one
micron in size up to rocks and boulders. The surface area of the dust in the
rings is vast, so much so that they radiate thermal energy at millimetere
wavelengths that can be detected with radio telescopes on the Earth. The most
sensitive sub-millimetre telescope is the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA)
in the Atacama desert in Chile. We were able to get observing time on this array
of telescopes in the Summer of 2018, and to our surprise we detected a sub-mm
source with the brightness we predicted for J1407b's rings.</p>

<p>After our initial joy, we then became confused again - because the ALMA
source wasn't exactly in the same position as the location of the star. At these
very long wavelengths, the star J1407 is not visible in ALMA, so we had to
calculated the expected location of the star and compare it to the ALMA source.
If the source is the same physical object that caused the eclipse in 2007, we
run into a big problem - the source cannot be in a gravitaionally bound orbit
around J1407.... but there's an very unlikely alternative explanation - that the
object we called J1407b is floating freely through the Galaxy, and just happened
to pass in front of a very young star.</p>

<p>This is very very unlikely to happen, but there's a first time for
everything.... and to confirm this tantalizing idea, we need another image from
the ALMA array. And as of 2020, we have not been able to get the observing time
to confirm or deny our latest idea. If this happens to be true, though, then we
will never see another eclipse of J1407.</p>

<p>So that is the latest and greatest information about J1407 and the ring
system around J1407b. We still think that the eclipse in 2007 was caused by
something orbiting J1407, and that one day we will see another eclipse that will
confirm the incomplete light curve from 2007. Once we see that eclipse, all the
geometry of the ring system is solved almost immediately. Until then, we tide
ourselves over and patiently wait for a triggering signal from an observer who
says "This star has started fading again!"</p>
