      <p>My research covers the <a href="direct_imaging/index.html#DI">search and characterisation of extrasolar planets by direct imaging</a>, and <a href="direct_imaging/index.html#Coronagraphs">developing optical instrumentation</a> to help find them. In the past few years I have been <a href="exorings/index.html">searching for circumplanetary disks and rings</a> by looking for the shadows they cast as they pass between us and their parent stars.</p>

    <h2>Directly imaged exoplanet around TYC 8998</h2>

<p>We discovered a 14 Jupiter mass companion to the solar mass star TYC 8998, sitting about 230au away from its parent star. Alex Bohn's paper shows the companion moving through space with the star, and its thermal emission is consistent with computer models. </p>

<h2>The bRing Project</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Looking at one star continuously for over one year</p>

<p>In 2017 and the start of 2018, the circumplanetary environment of the gast giant exoplanet Beta Pictoris b crossed in front of the bright young star Beta Pictoris, a naked eye 4th magnitude star in the Southern skies. We wanted to see if any circumplanetary material crossed in front of the star over this event lasting 300 days, and so I led the bRing project.</p>

<p>The <bold>Beta Pictoris b ring (bRing)</bold> project are two small robotic observatories in South Africa and Australia, each one consists of two telephoto lenses with support computers so that we can continuously monitor the path of Beta Pictoris across the Southern skies. The design builds on the heritage gained in Leiden from the MASCARA all sky survey camera units. To get longitudinal coverage, two separate bRing cameras were built (one by Leiden Observatory for South Africa and one by University of Rochester for Australia) and the data is combined with MASCARA South to provide redundant photometric coverage. The photometric precision is 0.5% with 5 minutes of data.</p>

Relating abstract concepts to more everyday experiences means that I typically use props to convey concepts, such as tone generators to demonstrate heterodyne radio receivers, and wooden marble games to explain how digital cameras work.</p>

<p>My teaching led to a student nomination for a Faculty Award for Education in the Science Faculty in Leiden in 2014.</p>

<p>My talk schedule for 2019 is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.pintofscience.nl/utrecht-black-holes-and-exoplanet">Pint of Science in Utrecht</a>, 20 May 2019</li>
  <li><a href="https://astronomyontap.org/locations/edinburgh-uk/">Astronomy on Tap, Edinburgh</a>, 11 June 2019</li>
  <li>Space Late, <a href="https://spacecentre.co.uk/whats-on/">National Space Centre</a>, Leicester, 05 October 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>Previous years have included notable talks at the inaugural Astronomy on Tap in Leiden (March 2017), Science Cafe Wageningen (Oct 2017), <a href="http://www.cubacity.us/districtschools">Cuba City Elementary, Middle and High Schools</a> (in 2013, 2016 and finally six grades and the Lego Robot Club in 2018), and several other schools in Britain and the US. Two talks at the <a href="https://www.surreycommunity.info/ewellastro/">Ewell Astronomical Society</a>, which I went to as a young astronomer, astronomy clubs in Arizona, and giving star parties at the Double Check Ranch in Arizona and for professional companies.</p>
