        <p>The web died several years ago, but like any giant dinosaur it takes time for the body to react to the death of the brain. I wrote my first web page back in 1995 or so, and I've treated it as a public place to occasionally put my thought, mostly lots of photos and essays for when I lived in America and I wanted to share my stories with relatives and friends back home, before Facebook or Instagram existed.</p>

        <p>It is usually where I host my teaching materials for courses at Leiden Observatory, digital copies of all my publications that are otherwise stuck behind paywalls, and the public face for Workshops, Meetings and my research ideas.</p>

        <p>Starting with writing HTML from scratch, I've gone through my own custom scripts in Perl, a blog system based on the bash shell, then settled on dokuwiki to serve Markdown pages in a pleasing format for almost a decade. I have been using org mode in Emacs for all my calendar appointments and scheduling, and since Emacs has a large hacker community supporting its development, there is inevitably an option to write org pages and have them be exported to HTML. I've been a long time enthusiast of Edward Tufte's books on style and graphics, liking the relative simplicity and clean style, so when I discovered <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">Tufte CSS</a><label for="sn-moi" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-moi" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Pretentious, moi?</span>, I've been trying to get emacs, org-mode, ox-tufte and tufte-css to play nicely together.</p>

        <p>I have failed miserably.</p>

        <p>Wondring how to solve this problem, I had a sudden burst of clarity and insight - I'm messing around with an unstable compilation chain using three different code bases, when I can quite happily bash out HTML by hand. So that's what I'm going back to. This is all written direct into HTML<label for="sn-atom" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-atom" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Well, I'm using the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom editor</a> which makes closing the tags and checking this into my GitHub account very easy.</span>, and synced up to the web server space at work. I'll get back to coding for astronomy projects and papers, and more time for making bread.</p>
