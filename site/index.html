<p>The web died several years ago, but like any giant dinosaur it takes time for the signal to travel from the brain to the rest of the body. I wrote my first web page back in 1995 or so, and I&rsquo;ve treated it as a public place to occasionally put my thoughts: mostly lots of photos and essays for when I lived in America and I wanted to share my stories with relatives and friends back home, before Facebook or Instagram existed. So far, so 1990&rsquo;s.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, it is where I present all my research to the rest of the world, put digital copies of all my publications that are otherwise stuck behind paywalls, where I host my teaching materials for courses at Leiden Observatory, and is the public face for workshops and meetings that I've organised.</p>

      <p>Starting with writing HTML from scratch, I&rsquo;ve gone through my own custom scripts in Perl, a blog system based on the bash shell, then settled on dokuwiki to serve Markdown pages in a pleasing format for almost a decade. I have been using org mode in Emacs for all my calendar appointments and scheduling, and since Emacs has a large hacker community supporting its development, there is inevitably an option to write org pages and have them be exported to HTML. I&rsquo;ve been a long time enthusiast of Edward Tufte&rsquo;s books on style and graphics, liking the relative simplicity and clean style, so when I discovered <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">Tufte CSS</a><label for="sn-moi" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-moi" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Pretentious, moi?</span>, I then set about getting emacs, org-mode, ox-tufte and tufte-css to play nicely together. It all appealed to the geek in me, but strangely enough I never seemed to get around to putting the results on the web.</p>

<p><label for="mn-wiley" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-wiley" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="wasting_my_time.jpg" alt="Me writing web pages using several computer scripts"/>Me writing web pages using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/?">emacs</a>, <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> and several other esoteric scripting languages. (Wile E. Coyote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_They_Go-Go-Go!">"There They Go-Go-Go!"</a> Warner Bros. Looney Tunes (1956).</span>

<p>Then, late one evening, I had a revelation: Why the hell was I faffing around with a pile of not-quite-stable tools when I can write HTML by hand instead? Life&rsquo;s simply too short to waste on tweaking computer scripts to make a web page. Write stuff, put it on the web. Job done.</p>

      <p>So that's what I&rsquo;m going back to. This is all written in HTML<label for="sn-atom" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-atom" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Well, I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom editor</a> which makes closing the tags and checking this into my GitHub account very easy.</span> with Tufte CSS by <a href="https://www.daveliepmann.com">Dave Liepmann</a> for styling, and synced up to the web server space at work. I&rsquo;ll get back to coding for astronomy projects and papers, and more time for making bread.</p>

      <p>All mistakes on these pages are my own. If you do decide to use any part of these web pages in presentations, please include a link to this page or at the very minimum, add &ldquo;M. Kenworthy&rdquo; somewhere visible.</p>
