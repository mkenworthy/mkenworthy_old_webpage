<p>Previous years have included notable talks at the inaugural Astronomy on Tap in Leiden (March 2017), Science Cafe Wageningen (Oct 2017), <a href="http://www.cubacity.us/districtschools">Cuba City Elementary, Middle and High Schools</a> (in 2013, 2016 and finally six grades and the Lego Robot Club in 2018), and several other schools in Britain and the US. Two talks at the <a href="https://www.surreycommunity.info/ewellastro/">Ewell Astronomical Society</a>, which I went to as a young astronomer, astronomy clubs in Arizona, and giving star parties at the Double Check Ranch in Arizona and for professional companies.</p>
